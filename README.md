# Coding Challenge: NYC Schools

```
GOAL: Verify candidate can provide a technical solution and follow instructions

REQUIREMENTS:
These requirements are rather high-level and vague. If details are omitted, it is because we will be
happy with any of a wide variety of solutions. Don't worry about finding "the" solution. Feel free
to be creative with the requirements. Your goal is to impress (but do so with clean code).

Create a browser based or native app to provide information on NYC High schools.

- Display a list of NYC High Schools. Get your data
  here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/DOE-High-School-Directory-2017/s3k6-pzi2
- Selecting a school should show additional information about the school Display all the SAT scores,
  including Math, Reading and Writing. SAT data here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4

It is up to you to decide what additional information to display In order to prevent you from 
running down rabbit holes that are less important to us, try to prioritize the following:

## What is Important
- Proper function – requirements met. Well constructed, easy-to-follow, commented code (especially
comment hacks or workarounds made in the interest of expediency (i.e. // given more time I would
prefer to wrap this in a blah blah blah pattern blah blah )). 
- Proper separation of concerns and best-practice coding patterns. 
- Defensive code that graciously handles unexpected edge cases. 

## What is Less Important
- UI design – generally, design is handled by a dedicated team in our group. 
- Demonstrating technologies or techniques you are not already familiar with. 

## Bonus Points!
- Unit Tests
- Good design (I know I said it was less important, but what I mean is I don't want a
beautiful, poorly constructed app). 
- Additional functionality 
- whatever you see fit. 

## iOS
For applications that include CocoaPods with their project code, having the Pods included in the
code commits as source is recommended. (Even though it goes against the CocoaPods general rules). Be
sure to use safe area insets Make sure your app is compatible with iPhone X.

## Android
Make sure you are correctly handing any necessary permissions. Please make sure you are using Java.
If you want to demonstrate the use of Kotlin, we'd rather you use a combination of both. As
mentioned, you are not expected to function in a vacuum. Use all the online resources you can find,
and please do contact us with questions or for interim feedback if you desire.
