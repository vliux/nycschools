The urban planning theme-based curriculum takes students out of the classroom and into their communities to develop skills that will move them toward higher education and careers, while at the same time tapping into their innate curiosity towards the world around them.</overview_paragraph><school_10th_seats>1</school_10th_seats><academicopportunities1>College NOW courses at Medgar Evers College</academicopportunities1><academicopportunities2>College Summit</academicopportunities2><academicopportunities3>National Academy Foundation: Green Technology, Coding, and Architecture courses</academicopportunities3><academicopportunities4>All students are expected to complete their NY State Regents Exam requirements by the end of their sophomore year</academicopportunities4><ell_programs>English as a New Language</ell_programs><language_classes>Spanish</language_classes><advancedplacement_courses>AP Biology, AP Calculus, AP Economics, AP English, AP Spanish, AP US History</advancedplacement_courses><neighborhood>Bushwick</neighborhood><shared_space>Yes</shared_space><campus_name>Bushwick Educational Campus</campus_name><building_code>K480</building_code><location>400 Irving Avenue, Brooklyn NY 11237 (40.696457, -73.911751)</location><phone_number>718-381-7100</phone_number><fax_number>718-418-0314</fax_number><school_email>knorman3@schools.nyc.gov</school_email><website>www.aupnyc.org</website><subway>L, M to Myrtle Ave-Wyckoff Ave</subway><bus>B13, B20, B26, B38, B52, B54, B60, Q55, Q58</bus><grades2018>9-12</grades2018><finalgrades>9-12</finalgrades><total_students>227</total_students><start_time>8:15am</start_time><end_time>3:45pm</end_time><addtl_info1>Community School</addtl_info1><extracurricular_activities>Advanced Art, African Dance, African Drumming, Annual Â“Day of DialogueÂ” Student-led Conference, Cheerleading, Community Service, Fine Arts, Hispanic Cultural Club, National Honor Society, Peer Mediation, Peer Tutoring, Student Government, Student Leadership Council, Student Newspaper, Video Game Club</extracurricular_activities><psal_sports_boys>Baseball, Basketball, Soccer, Volleyball</psal_sports_boys><psal_sports_girls>Basketball, Softball, Volleyball</psal_sports_girls><school_sports>Baseball, Basketball, Flag Football, Volleyball, Weightlifting</school_sports><graduation_rate>0.55400002</graduation_rate><attendance_rate>0.819999993</attendance_rate><pct_stu_enough_variety>0.720000029</pct_stu_enough_variety><college_career_rate>0.307000011</college_career_rate><pct_stu_safe>0.790000021</pct_stu_safe><school_accessibility_description>1</school_accessibility_description><prgdesc1>Students take urban studies theme-based electives and participate in urban planning projects in regular subject area classes that incorporate art, technology, community development, and civic engagement.</prgdesc1><offer_rate1>Â—82% of offers went to this group</offer_rate1><program1>Urban Planning and Design</program1><code1>K52A</code1><interest1>Humanities &amp; Interdisciplinary</interest1><method1>Limited Unscreened</method1><seats9ge1>94</seats9ge1><grade9gefilledflag1>N</grade9gefilledflag1><grade9geapplicants1>142</grade9geapplicants1><seats9swd1>19</seats9swd1><grade9swdfilledflag1>N</grade9swdfilledflag1><grade9swdapplicants1>51</grade9swdapplicants1><seats101>Yes-10</seats101><admissionspriority11>Priority to Brooklyn students or residents who attend an information session</admissionspriority11><admissionspriority21>Then to New York City residents who attend an information session</admissionspriority21><admissionspriority31>Then to Brooklyn students or residents</admissionspriority31><admissionspriority41>Then to New York City residents</admissionspriority41><grade9geapplicantsperseat1>2</grade9geapplicantsperseat1><grade9swdapplicantsperseat1>3</grade9swdapplicantsperseat1><primary_address_line_1>400 Irving Avenue</primary_address_line_1><city>Brooklyn</city><zip>11237</zip><state_code>NY</state_code><latitude>40.69646</latitude><longitude>-73.9118</longitude><community_board>4</community_board><council_district>37</council_district><census_tract>435</census_tract><bin>3076908</bin><bbl>3033650098</bbl><nta>Bushwick North                                                             </nta><borough>BROOKLYN </borough></row><row _id="row-g63x-k6a9-racn" _uuid="00000000-0000-0000-9837-0C490C1E2075" _position="0" _address="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/s3k6-pzi2/row-g63x-k6a9-racn"><dbn>10X351</dbn><school_name>Bronx Collaborative High School</school_name><boro>X</boro><overview_paragraph>Bronx Collaborative students are academic detectives, bringing New York CityÂ’s unique resources and rich history into the classroom to investigate and solve real-world challenges.

Preparing students for college and the world of work is a necessity, so we employ a full-time College Bound Initiative counselor and various staff from community-based organizations (Liberty Partnership, Morris Heights Center) to support us in reaching that goal.</overview_paragraph><school_10th_seats>1</school_10th_seats><academicopportunities1>iLearnNYC: Program for expanded online coursework and self-paced learning</academicopportunities1><academicopportunities2>Nutrition and Weight Management Anatomy and Exercise Physiology Sports Marketing Web Design Artistic Textiles GE Skills Project based Learning</academicopportunities2><academicopportunities3>Internships in Health Careers</academicopportunities3><academicopportunities4>College Bound Initiative</academicopportunities4><academicopportunities5>Health-related programs and courses</academicopportunities5><ell_programs>English as a New Language</ell_programs><language_classes>Japanese, Spanish</language_classes><advancedplacement_courses>AP Biology, AP English, AP European History, AP Spanish, AP US History</advancedplacement_courses><neighborhood>West Concourse</neighborhood><shared_space>Yes</shared_space><building_code>X884</building_code><location>350 Gerard Avenue, Bronx NY 10451 (40.815712, -73.92996)</location><phone_number>718-401-1826</phone_number><fax_number>718-401-1632</fax_number><school_email>jmchedlishvili@schools.nyc.gov</school_email><website>www.hopschool.com</website><subway>2 to 149th St-Grand Concourse ; 3 to 145th St ; 4, 5 to 138th St - Grand Concourse ; 6 to 3rd Ave - 138th St</subway><bus>Bx1, Bx13, Bx15, Bx19, Bx2, Bx21, Bx32, Bx33, M1, M102, M7</bus><grades2018>9-12</grades2018><finalgrades>9-12</finalgrades><total_students>554</total_students><start_time>8:15am</start_time><end_time>2:35pm</end_time><addtl_info1>College Trips; Community Service Expected; Health Center; Internship Expected; Online Grading System; Saturday Programs; Student/Parent Orientation; Summer Bridge Program; Summer Internships</addtl_info1><extracurricular_activities>Digital Photography, Drama, National Honor Society/Arista, Student Government, Dance Team, World Dance, Yearbook, Introduction to Medical Careers, Creative Writing, Chorus, Art Therapy, Recycling Club, Film and Society, Healthy Angels, Tutoring and Peer Tutoring</extracurricular_activities><psal_sports_boys>Baseball, Basketball, Soccer</psal_sports_boys><psal_sports_girls>Basketball, Cross Country, Outdoor Track, Soccer, Softball</psal_sports_girls><psal_sports_coed>Stunt</psal_sports_coed><school_sports>Swimming</school_sports><graduation_rate>0.609000027</graduation_rate><attendance_rate>0.790000021</attendance_rate><pct_stu_enough_variety>0.829999983</pct_stu_enough_variety><college_career_rate>0.398000002</college_career_rate><pct_stu_safe>0.829999983</pct_stu_safe><school_accessibility_description>1</school_accessibility_description><program1>Health Opportunities High School</program1><code1>X71A</code1><interest1>Health Professions</interest1><method1>Ed.

We encourage all students to take part in extracurricular activities throughout their high school tenure.</overview_paragraph><academicopportunities1>CUNY College Now Courses, Upward Bound</academicopportunities1><academicopportunities2>Community Service, Internships</academicopportunities2><academicopportunities3>Theater, School Newsletter, Anthologies, Art-Projects</academicopportunities3><ell_programs>English as a New Language</ell_programs><language_classes>Spanish</language_classes><advancedplacement_courses>AP English, AP Environmental Science, AP World History</advancedplacement_courses><neighborhood>Williamsbridge-Olinville</neighborhood><shared_space>Yes</shared_space><campus_name>Evander Childs Educational Campus</campus_name><building_code>X425</building_code><location>800 East Gun Hill Road, Bronx NY 10467 (40.875172, -73.861649)</location><phone_number>718-944-5660</phone_number><fax_number>718-944-5690</fax_number><school_email>JMason8@schools.nyc.gov</school_email><website>www.bhswca.com</website><subway>2, 5 to Gun Hill Rd</subway><bus>Bx28, Bx30, Bx38, Bx39, Bx41, Bx41-SBS, Bx8, BxM11</bus><grades2018>9-12</grades2018><finalgrades>9-12</finalgrades><total_students>371</total_students><start_time>8am</start_time><end_time>3pm</end_time><addtl_info1>Extended Day Program (Tutoring); Internships; Saturday Programs; Uniform</addtl_info1><extracurricular_activities>Art Society, Costume and Set Design, Dance, Journalism, Martial Arts, the Music Lab, Talent and Fashion, Theater, Literary Magazine, National Honor Society, Student Government, Martial Arts, Music Lab, Technology</extracurricular_activities><psal_sports_boys>Baseball, Basketball, Cross Country, Football, Indoor Track, Outdoor Track, Soccer, Swimming</psal_sports_boys><psal_sports_girls>Basketball, Cross Country, Indoor Track, Outdoor Track, Softball, Swimming, Volleyball</psal_sports_girls><school_sports>Intramural Sports</school_sports><graduation_rate>0.513000011</graduation_rate><attendance_rate>0.829999983</attendance_rate><pct_stu_enough_variety>0.75</pct_stu_enough_variety><college_career_rate>0.398000002</college_career_rate><pct_stu_safe>0.819999993</pct_stu_safe><school_accessibility_description>1</school_accessibility_description><offer_rate1>Â—74% of offers went to this group</offer_rate1><program1>Bronx High School for Writing &amp; Communication Arts</program1><code1>X76X</code1><interest1>Communications</interest1><method1>Limited Unscreened</method1><seats9ge1>86</seats9ge1><grade9gefilledflag1>N</grade9gefilledflag1><grade9geapplicants1>332</grade9geapplicants1><seats9swd1>22</seats9swd1><grade9swdfilledflag1>N</grade9swdfilledflag1><grade9swdapplicants1>76</grade9swdapplicants1><seats101>No</seats101><admissionspriority11>Priority to Bronx students or residents who attend an information session</admissionspriority11><admissionspriority21>Then to New York City residents who attend an information session</admissionspriority21><admissionspriority31>Then to Bronx students or residents</admissionspriority31><admissionspriority41>Then to New York City residents</admissionspriority41><grade9geapplicantsperseat1>4</grade9geapplicantsperseat1><grade9swdapplicantsperseat1>3</grade9swdapplicantsperseat1><primary_address_line_1>800 East Gun Hill Road</primary_address_line_1><city>Bronx</city><zip>10467</zip><state_code>NY</state_code><latitude>40.87517</latitude><longitude>-73.8616</longitude><community_board>12</community_board><council_district>12</council_district><census_tract>372</census_tract><bin>2057045</bin><bbl>2046330040</bbl><nta>Williamsbridge-Olinville                                                   </nta><borough>BRONX    </borough></row><row _id="row-6ud7_42mv.6a9i" _uuid="00000000-0000-0000-9823-0200E28A9638" _position="0" _address="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/s3k6-pzi2/row-6ud7_42mv.6a9i"><dbn>10X237</dbn><school_name>The Marie Curie School for Medicine, Nursing, and Health Professions</school_name><boro>X</boro><overview_paragraph>Our goal is to inspire students to learn as much as they can about health to prepare them for life experiences and future careers in health-related professions.

Each student is motivated to meet the Common Core Learning Standards, to respect and appreciate individuals of different cultures, and to be a contributing citizen to their community.</overview_paragraph><school_10th_seats>1</school_10th_seats><academicopportunities1>CTE program(s) in: Agriculture, Food, and Natural Resources</academicopportunities1><academicopportunities2>Bowne offers programs in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM), Agriculture, Academy for Creative Artists, and JROTC</academicopportunities2><academicopportunities3>Our school has the only NY State approved Agriculture program in NYC where students may receive CTE endorsement in Plant and Animal Science</academicopportunities3><academicopportunities4>Students have the opportunity to work on our own four-acre farm and spend summers on actual working sites throughout New York State</academicopportunities4><academicopportunities5>Our students are exposed to an array of post secondary opportunities through several partnerships with universities, industries, and organizations.</academicopportunities5><ell_programs>English as a New Language; Transitional Bilingual Education: Chinese, Spanish</ell_programs><language_classes>Chinese (Mandarin), French, Italian, Latin, Spanish</language_classes><advancedplacement_courses>AP Biology, AP Calculus, AP Chemistry, AP Chinese, AP Computer Science, AP Economics, AP English, AP European History, AP Physics, AP Spanish, AP US Government and Politics, AP US History</advancedplacement_courses><diplomaendorsements>CTE, Math, Science</diplomaendorsements><neighborhood>Kew Gardens Hills</neighborhood><building_code>Q425</building_code><location>63-25 Main Street, Flushing NY 11367 (40.737448, -73.823841)</location><phone_number>718-263-1919</phone_number><fax_number>718-575-4069</fax_number><school_email>ICastillo@schools.nyc.gov</school_email><website>www.johnbowne.org</website><subway>N/A</subway><bus>Q17, Q20A, Q20B, Q25, Q34, Q44-SBS, Q88</bus><grades2018>9-12</grades2018><finalgrades>9-12</finalgrades><total_students>3566</total_students><start_time>9:08am</start_time><end_time>3:47pm</end_time><addtl_info1>Summer Orientation</addtl_info1><extracurricular_activities>African, Animal Care/Science, Journalism, Sales, Anime, Anti-Bullying, Arista, Art, Aspire, Book, Cheer, Science Olympiad, Chess, Conflict Res., Dance, Debate, Desi, Drama, Educate for Peace, Duelist, Equine, Euro, Fashion, Film, Floriculture, Foreign Language/Culture, FFA, Glee, Green, Indo-Pak, ROTC, KPop, Key, Latin, Livestock, Mock Trial, Moot Court, Muslim, NYCSEF, Intel, SIS, Peer Mediation, Robotics, Civil Engineering, Student Ambassador, Plant Science, Student Union, Wrestling, Yearbook</extracurricular_activities><psal_sports_boys>Baseball, Basketball, Bowling, Cross Country, Handball, Indoor Track, Outdoor Track, Soccer, Tennis, Volleyball, Wrestling</psal_sports_boys><psal_sports_girls>Badminton, Basketball, Cross Country, Handball, Indoor Track, Outdoor Track, Soccer, Softball, Table Tennis, Tennis, Volleyball</psal_sports_girls><psal_sports_coed>Cricket, Golf, Stunt</psal_sports_coed><school_sports>Equestrian Team</school_sports><graduation_rate>0.703000009</graduation_rate><attendance_rate>0.819999993</attendance_rate><pct_stu_enough_variety>0.800000012</pct_stu_enough_variety><college_career_rate>0.528999984</college_career_rate><pct_stu_safe>0.74000001</pct_stu_safe><school_accessibility_description>1</school_accessibility_description><prgdesc1>Academy for Creative Artists (A.C.A.) is a vibrant community of young artists and their teachers.

Dance: Come dressed in proper dance attire consisting of leotard, tights, and ballet shoes with hair placed in a bun (girls) or black jazz pants and white tee shirt (boys). Auditioning students will take a ballet barre led by the teacher. Auditioning students will have the opportunity to present a short one minute dance of your choice and bring your own music. Drama: Prepare two contrasting memorized monologues from a play, movie or novel, each one minute long. You may be asked to participate in a group theater game. Instrumental Music: This program offers a jazz curriculum for students who play band and rhythm section instruments. We do not have a string program. Students must bring their own instrument, sticks and music to the audition. Be prepared to play a scale and selection of music from a book or solo of your own choice, and sight-read. You will complete a questionnaire, interview, and take a simple test for musical aptitude. Vocal Music: Perform a prepared song without CD/piano accompaniment from the following list: Amazing Grace, Simple Gifts, The National Anthem (Star Spangled Banner), My Favorite Things, God Bless America, Happy Birthday and Somewhere. Students should avoid Top 40 or Pop music when at all possible. Applicants will also be evaluated on tonal memory, rhythmic and aural skills and vocal technique through teacher-led vocal exercises. Visual Art: Prepare and present a professional portfolio (work completed on drawing paper, canvas or photographed) of at least five pieces of original work drawn from real-life observations (including one self-portrait, one still-life and one landscape). The portfolio needs to show a range of style. Sketchbooks are welcomed as extra drawings. Auditioning students will be required to complete one detailed, shaded, and colored drawing from observation during the audition.</auditioninformation1><grade9geapplicantsperseat1>6</grade9geapplicantsperseat1><grade9swdapplicantsperseat1>6</grade9swdapplicantsperseat1><primary_address_line_1>500 East Fordham Road</primary_address_line_1><city>Bronx</city><zip>10458</zip><state_code>NY</state_code><latitude>40.85947</latitude><longitude>-73.8886</longitude><community_board>6</community_board><council_district>15</council_district><census_tract>387</census_tract><bin>2011810</bin><bbl>2030590001</bbl><nta>Belmont                                                                    </nta><borough>BRONX    </borough></row><row _id="row-irf3.8txf~tuat" _uuid="00000000-0000-0000-71A6-16E7ED57B7E4" _position="0" _address="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/s3k6-pzi2/row-irf3.8txf~tuat"><dbn>24Q485</dbn><school_name>Grover Cleveland High School</school_name><boro>Q</boro><overview_paragraph>We provide a nurturing learning environment that enables all students to achieve their college and career readiness goals.</overview_paragraph><school_10th_seats>1</school_10th_seats><academicopportunities1>CTE program(s) in: Architecture and Construction, Arts, A/V Technology &amp; Communication, Business, Management &amp; Administration, Health Science</academicopportunities1><academicopportunities2>CTE program(s) in: Hospitality and Tourism, Information Technology</academicopportunities2><academicopportunities3>iLearnNYC: Program for expanded online coursework and self-paced learning; BELA (Bridge to English Language Acquisition)</academicopportunities3><academicopportunities4>Students with Transitional Bilingual Education services work with a dedicated counselor.</academicopportunities4><academicopportunities5>Academy of Arts (Music, Fine Arts, Theater, and Media Installation); Water Safety Instruction; College Now!

Instead of high stakes tests, our students complete Performance-Based Assessment Tasks (PBATs). These in-depth, analytical papers require extensive reading, writing, research, and revision. We foster a strong college-going culture by providing a full-time counselor, offering a college/career elective to seniors, and celebrating during our annual college march. Students join a crew, a small class where they receive academic support, develop character, and reflect on growth. Through these experiences, students learn to embody our four core values of leading, learning, contributing, and exploring.</overview_paragraph><academicopportunities1>Performance-Based Assessment Tasks (PBATs) instead of standardized tests (except for the Common Core English exam) fulfill graduation requirements.</academicopportunities1><academicopportunities2>Standards-based grading tracks students' progress, and their grades reflect growth over a semester rather than a one-time, all-or-nothing score.</academicopportunities2><academicopportunities3>Leaders provides a full-time college counselor, our college/career course for juniors and seniors, and a chance to celebrate at our College March.</academicopportunities3><academicopportunities4>Student-led conferences (SLCs) allow students to present their strengths, growth areas, and goals and take the lead in their own learning.</academicopportunities4><academicopportunities5>During Intensives regular classes are suspended and students sign up to explore a topic in-depth with visits from experts and fieldwork in the city.</academicopportunities5><ell_programs>English as a New Language</ell_programs><language_classes>Spanish</language_classes><advancedplacement_courses>AP Calculus</advancedplacement_courses><neighborhood>Gravesend</neighborhood><shared_space>Yes</shared_space><campus_name>Lafayette Educational Campus</campus_name><building_code>K400</building_code><location>2630 Benson Avenue, Brooklyn NY 11214 (40.593028, -73.986313)</location><phone_number>718-333-7700</phone_number><fax_number>718-333-7725</fax_number><school_email>dohara@leaders6-12.org</school_email><website>www.leadersschool.net</website><subway>D to 25th Ave; N to Ave U; N to Gravesend  Â–  86th St</subway><bus>B1, B3, B4, B6, B64, B82, X28, X38</bus><grades2018>9-12</grades2018><finalgrades>9-12</finalgrades><total_students>283</total_students><start_time>8:35am</start_time><end_time>3:25pm</end_time><extracurricular_activities>Clubs vary from year to year based on student interest, but past offerings have included Anime Club, Art Studio, Chess Club, College Start, Peer Mediators, Peer Mentors, Photography, Poetry, SAT Prep, Science Club, Student Government, Theater, Video Games, and Yearbook.

Our extensive elective course offerings, including Advanced Placement (AP) and CUNY College Now classes, empower our academic achievers to complete up to a year of college credit before graduation.</overview_paragraph><school_10th_seats>1</school_10th_seats><academicopportunities1>CTE program(s) in: Business, Management &amp; Administration, Health Science</academicopportunities1><academicopportunities2>We offer a photography studio, two animal science labs, a vast library, computer labs, spacious grounds, three gymnasiums, and a swimming pool.</academicopportunities2><academicopportunities3>The Institute for Professions in Science (IPS), The Gilder Lehrman Honors Institute for American Studies</academicopportunities3><ell_programs>English as a New Language</ell_programs><language_classes>Chinese (Cantonese), Spanish</language_classes><advancedplacement_courses>AP Calculus, AP English, AP Environmental Science, AP Human Geography, AP Statistics, AP World History</advancedplacement_courses><diplomaendorsements>Science</diplomaendorsements><neighborhood>West Brighton</neighborhood><shared_space>Yes</shared_space><building_code>K410</building_code><location>2800 Ocean Parkway, Brooklyn NY 11235 (40.582627, -73.968733)</location><phone_number>718-333-7400</phone_number><fax_number>718-946-5035</fax_number><school_email>21K410@schools.nyc.gov</school_email><website>www.AbrahamLincolnHS.net</website><subway>B to Brighton Beach; F to Neptune Ave-Van Siclen; Q to Ocean Parkway</subway><bus>B1, B36, B4, B68</bus><grades2018>9-12</grades2018><finalgrades>9-12</finalgrades><total_students>2108</total_students><start_time>7:28am</start_time><end_time>3:10pm</end_time><extracurricular_activities>Acting Studio, Animal Care Squad, Anime, Arist National Honor Society, Cheerleading, Chess, Chinese, Conflict Negotiation and Mediation, Debate Team, ELL Acting Studio, Gay-Straight Alliance, Guitar, Hiking, History, Key Club, Landmark Yearbook, Library Squad, Lincoln Ambassadors, Lincoln Log Newspaper, Marine Lab Squad, South Asian, Student Organization, Weightlifting</extracurricular_activities><psal_sports_boys>Baseball, Basketball, Bowling, Football, Handball, Indoor Track, Lacrosse, Outdoor Track, Soccer, Swimming, Tennis, Volleyball, Wrestling</psal_sports_boys><psal_sports_girls>Basketball, Bowling, Cross Country, Handball, Indoor Track, Lacrosse, Outdoor Track, Soccer, Softball, Swimming, Tennis, Volleyball</psal_sports_girls><psal_sports_coed>Cricket</psal_sports_coed><graduation_rate>0.657999992</graduation_rate><attendance_rate>0.829999983</attendance_rate><pct_stu_enough_variety>0.800000012</pct_stu_enough_variety><college_career_rate>0.542999983</college_career_rate><pct_stu_safe>0.75</pct_stu_safe><geoeligibility>Open only to Brooklyn students/residents</geoeligibility><school_accessibility_description>1</school_accessibility_description><prgdesc1>Hands-on experience, career preparation, and technical knowledge gained by working with vertebrates and invertebrates in a laboratory setting.</prgdesc1><prgdesc2>Virtual Enterprise (VE) is a simulated business that is set up and run by students with the guidance of a teacher/facilitator and a business partner.
